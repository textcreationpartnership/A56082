            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALthough the Nature and State of Affairs relating to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this Province, is ſo well and notoriouſly known to all Perſons any way concerned in the ſame, as to the People and Inhabitants here, who are more immediately In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted, as might excuſe any <hi>Declaration</hi> or <hi>Apology</hi> for this preſent inevitable <hi>Appearance:</hi> Yet foraſmuch as (by the <hi>Plots, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances, Inſinuations, Remonſtrances,</hi> and <hi>Subſcriptions,</hi> carried on, ſuggeſted, extorted, and obtained by the Lord <hi>Baltemore,</hi> his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35018:2"/>Repreſentatives, and Officers here) the <hi>Injuſtice</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> under which we <hi>groan,</hi> is palliated, and moſt, if not all the Particulars of our <hi>Grievances</hi> ſhrouded from the Eye of Obſervation, and the Hand of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. We thought fit for general Satisfaction, and particularly to undeceive thoſe that may have a ſiniſter Account of our <hi>Proceedings,</hi> to Publiſh this <hi>Declaration,</hi> of the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> inducing us thereunto.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip's Right and Title to the Government, is by Virtue of a Charter to his Father <hi>Cecilius,</hi> from King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, of Bleſſed Memory. How his preſent Lordſhip has managed the Powers and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities given and granted in the ſame, We could Mourn and Lament only in ſilence, would our Duty to God, our Allegeance to his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, and the Care and Welfare of our Selves, and Poſterity, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us.</p>
            <p>In the Firſt Place, In the ſaid Charter, is a Reſervation of the Faith and Allegeance due to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> (the Province and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants being immediately ſubject thereunto) but how little that is manifeſted, is too obvious to all unbiaſſed Perſons that ever had any thing to do here; The very name and owning of that Soveraign Power is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Crime enough to incur the Frowns of our Superiors, and to render our Perſons obnoxious and ſuſpected to be Ill Affected to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>The Ill Uſage and Affronts to the King's Officers belonging to the Cuſtoms here, were a ſufficient Argument of this; We need but inſtance the Buſineſs of Mr. <hi>Badcock</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rousby,</hi> of whom the former was forcibly detained by his Lordſhip, from going home to make his juſt Complaints in <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> upon which he was ſoon taken Sick, and 'twas more than probably conjectured that the Conceit of his Confinement was the chief Cauſe of his Death, which ſoon after happened. The other was Barbarouſly Murthered upon the Execution of his Office, by one that was an <hi>Iriſh Papiſt,</hi> and our Chief Governor.</p>
            <p>Allegeance here, by theſe Perſons under whom We Suffer, is little talk'd of, other then what they would have done and ſworn to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the Lord Proprietary; for it was very lately owned by the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent himſelf, openly enough in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Houſe of Aſſembly, That Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to his Lordſhip was Allegeance, and that the denial of the one, was the ſame thing with refuſal or denial of the other.</hi> In that very <hi>Oath of Fidelity</hi> that was then impoſed under the Penalty and Threats of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, there is not ſo much as the leaſt word or intimation of any <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Faith,</hi> or <hi>Allegeance</hi> to be reſerved to Our Soveraign Lord the King of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:35018:3"/>How the <hi>Jus Regale</hi> is improved here, and made the Prerogative of his Lordſhip, is too ſenſibly felt by us all, in that abſolute Authority ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed over us, and by the greateſt part of the Inhabitants, in the Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure of their perſons, Forfeiture and Loſs of their Goods, Chattels, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds and Inheritances.</p>
            <p>In the next place, Churches and Chappels (which by the ſaid Charter ſhould be Built and Conſecrated, according to the Eccleſiaſtical Laws of the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi>) to our great Regret and Diſcouragement of our <hi>Religion,</hi> are erected and converted to the uſe of <hi>Popiſh Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superſtition,</hi> Jeſuits and Seminary Prieſts, are the only Incumbents (for which there is a Supply provided, by ſending our Popiſh Youth to be Educated at St. <hi>Omers</hi>) as alſo the chief Adviſers and Councellors in Affairs of Government, and the Richeſt and moſt Fertile Land ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for their Uſe and Maintenance; while other Lands that are piouſly intended, and given for the Maintenance of the Proteſtant Miniſtry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Eſcheat, and are taken as Forfeit, the Miniſters themſelves diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and no care taken for their Subſiſtance.</p>
            <p>The Power to Enact Laws, is another branch of his Lordſhip's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but how well that has been Executed and Circumſtanced, is too notorious. His preſent Lordſhip upon the Death of his Father, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereunto, ſent out Writs for Four (as was ever the uſuage) for each County to ſerve as Repreſentatives of the People; but when Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there were Two only of each Reſpective Four, pick'd out and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to that Convention. Whereby many Laws were made, and the greateſt Levy yet known, laid upon the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>The next Seſſion, the Houſe was filled up with the remaining Two that was left out of the former, in which there were many and the beſt of our Laws Enacted, to the great Benefit and Satisfaction of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But his Lordſhip ſoon after Diſſolved and Declared the beſt of thoſe Laws, ſuch as he thought fit, null and void by <hi>Proclamation;</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they were Aſſented to in his Lordſhip's Name by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, in his abſence, and he himſelf ſometime Perſonally Acted and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the ſame; ſo that the <hi>Queſtion</hi> in our <hi>Courts of Judicature,</hi> in any point that relates to many of our Laws, is not ſo much the relation it has to the ſaid Laws, but whether the Laws themſelves be agreeable to the Approbation and Pleaſure of his Lordſhip? Whereby our Liberty and Property is become <hi>uncertain,</hi> and under the <hi>Arbitrary Diſpoſition</hi> of the <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of our Coures of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Aſſembly being ſometime after Diſſolved by <hi>Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> another was Elected and met, conſiſting only of Two Members for each County, directly oppoſite to an Act of Aſſembly for Four, in which ſeveral Laws, with his Lordſhip's Perſonal Aſſent, were En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted: Among the which, one for the <hi>Encouragement of Trade,</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35018:4"/>Erecting of Towns. But the Execution of that Act was ſoon after by <hi>Proclamation</hi> from his Lordſhip out of <hi>England,</hi> ſuſpended the laſt Year, and all Officers Military and Civil, ſeverely prohibited, executing or inflicting the Penalties of the ſame. Notwithſtanding which ſuſpenſion, being in effect a diſſolution and abrogating the whole Act, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of Three Pence to the Government by the ſaid Act, payable for every Hogſhead of Tobacco Exported, is carefully Exacted and Collected.</p>
            <p>How Fatal, and of what <hi>Pernicious Conſequence,</hi> that Unlimited and Arbitrary pretended <hi>Authority</hi> may be to the Inhabitants, is too appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but by conſidering, That by the ſame Reaſon, all the reſt of our Laws, whereby our Liberry and Property ſubſiſts, are ſubject to the ſame Arbitrary Diſpoſition, and if timely Remedy be not had, muſt ſtand or fall according to his Lordſhip's Good Will and Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Nor is this <hi>Nullifying</hi> and <hi>Suſpending Power</hi> the only <hi>Grievance</hi> that doth perplex and burthen us, in relation to Laws; but theſe Laws that are of a certain and unqueſtioned acceptation, are executed and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, as they are more or leſs agreeable to the good liking of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours in particular; One very good Law provides, That Orphan Children ſhould be diſpoſed of to Perſons of the ſame Religion with that of their deceaſed Parents. In <hi>direct oppoſition</hi> to which, ſeveral Children of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have been committed to the Tutelage of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and brought up in the <hi>Romiſh Superſtition.</hi> We could inſtance in a Young Woman, that has been lately forced, by Order of Council, from her Husband, committed to the Cuſtody of a <hi>Papiſt</hi> and brought up in his <hi>Religion.</hi> 'Tis endleſs to enumerate the particulars of this nature, while on the contrary, thoſe Laws that enhance the Grandeur and Income of his ſaid Lordſhip are ſeverely Impoſed and Executed; eſpecially one that againſt all Senſe, Equity, Reaſon, and Law, Puniſhes all Speeches, Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, and Attempts relating to his Lordſhip and Government, that ſhall be thought Mutinous and Seditious by the Judges of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Court, with either Whipping, Branding, Boreing through the Tongue, Fine, Impriſonment, Baniſhment, or Death; all, or either of the ſaid Puniſhments, at the Diſcretion of the ſaid Judges; who have given a very recent and remarkable Proof of their Authority in each particular Puniſhment aforeſaid, upon ſeveral of the good People of this Province, while the reſt are in the ſame danger to have their Words and Actions liable to the Conſtructions and Puniſhment of the ſaid Judges, and their Lives and Fortunes to the Mercy of their Arbitrary Fancies, Opinions, and Sentences.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35018:6"/>have hitherto, with Patience lain under and ſubmitted too; hoping that the ſame Hand of Providence, that hath ſuſtained us under them, would at length in due time releaſe us; and now at length, For as much as it has pleaſed Almighty God, by means of the great Prudence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the beſt of Princes; Our moſt gracious King <hi>Witham,</hi> to put a Check to the great Innundation of Slavery and Popery, that had like to overwhelm <hi>Their Majeſties</hi> Proteſtant Subjects in all their <hi>Territories</hi> and <hi>Dominions</hi> (of which none have ſuffered more, or are in greater Danger than our ſelves) we hope and expected in our particular Stations and Qualifications; a proportionable Share of ſo great a Bleſſing. But to our great Grief and Conſternation, upon the firſt News of the great Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and happy Change in <hi>England;</hi> we found our ſelves ſurrounded with Strong and Violent Endeavours from our <hi>Governours</hi> here, being the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi>'s Deputies and Repreſentatives, to defeat us of the ſame.</p>
            <p>We ſtill find all the means uſed by theſe very Perſons and their Agents; <hi>Jeſuits, Prieſts,</hi> and lay <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that Art or Malice can ſuggeſt, to divert the Obedience and Loyalty of the Inhabitants from Their Moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Majeſties,</hi> to that heighth of Impudence, that ſolemn Maſſes and Prayers are uſed <hi>(as we have very good Information)</hi> in their <hi>Chappels</hi> and <hi>Oratories,</hi> for the proſperous Succeſs of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Forces in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Deſigns againſt <hi>England,</hi> whereby they would involve us in the ſame Crime of Diſloyalty with themſelves, and render us Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the Inſupportable Diſpleaſure of Their Majeſties.</p>
            <p>We every where hear, not only Publick Proteſtation againſt Their Majeſties Right and Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> but their moſt Illuſtrious Perſons villified and aſpers'd with the worſt and moſt Traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Expreſſions of Obloquy and Detraction.</p>
            <p>We are every day threatned with the Loſs of our Lives, Liberties, and Eſtates, of which we have great Reaſon to think our ſelves in Immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Danger, by the Practices and Machinations that are on foot to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray us, to the <hi>French, Northern,</hi> and other <hi>Indians,</hi> of which, ſome have been dealt withal, and others Invited to Aſſiſt in our Deſtruction; <hi>well remembring the Incurſion and Iurode of the ſaid Northern Indians,</hi> in the Year 1681; who were conducted into the Heart of the <hi>Province,</hi> by <hi>French Jeſuits,</hi> and lay ſore upon us, <hi>while the Repreſentatives of the Country, then in the Aſſembly,</hi> were ſeverely preſs'd upon by our Superiors, to yield them an Unlimited and Tiranical Power in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Militia. As ſo great a Piece of Villany cannot be the Reſult, but of the worſt of Principles; ſo we ſhould with the greateſt Difficulties, believe it to be true, if Undeniable Evidence and Circumſtances did not convince us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:35018:7"/>Together with the Promiſes, we have; with all due Thinking and Deliberation, conſidered the Endeavours that are making to Diſunite us among our ſelves, to make and Inflame Differences in our Neighbour <hi>Colony</hi> of <hi>Virginia,</hi> from whoſe Friendſhip, Vieinity, great Loyalty and <hi>Sameneſs</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> we may expect Aſſiſtance in our greateſt Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>We have conſidered, that all the other Branches of Their Majeſties <hi>Dominions</hi> in this Part of the World <hi>(as well as we could be informed)</hi> have done their Duty in Proclaiming and Aſſerting their undoubted Right in theſe, <hi>and all other Their Majeſties Territories and Countries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But above all, with Due and Mature Deliberation, we have reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon that vaſt Gratitude and Duty incumbent likewiſe upon us, <hi>To our Soveraign Lord and Lady, the King and Queen's moſt Excellent Majeſties,</hi> in which, as it would not be ſafe for us; ſo it will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us to be Silent, in ſo great and General a <hi>Jubile,</hi> withal conſidering and looking upon our ſelves, Diſcharged, Diſſolved, and Free from all manner of Duty, Obligation, or Fidelity, to the Deputies, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, or Chief Magiſtrates here, as ſuch: <hi>They having Departed from their Allegiance</hi> (upon which alone our ſaid Duty and Fidelity to them depends) and by their Complices and Agents aforeſaid, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Deſtruction of our Religion, Lives, Liberties, and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, all which they are bound to Protect.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Reaſons, Motives and Conſiderations, <hi>which we do De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, have induced us to take up Arms, to Preſerve, Vindicate, and Aſſert, the Sovereign Dominion, and Right, of King</hi> WILLIAM <hi>and Queen</hi> MARY, <hi>to this Province:</hi> To Defend the <hi>Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> among us, and to Protect and Shelter the <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Violence, Oppreſſion,</hi> and <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> that is Plotted and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned againſt them; which we do Solemnly Declare and Proteſt, <hi>we have no Deſigns</hi> or <hi>Intentions</hi> whatſoever.</p>
            <p>For the more Effectuate Accompliſhments of which, We will take due Care, that a Free and full Aſſembly be Called, and Convened with all Poſſible Expedition, by whom we may likewiſe have our Condition and Circumſtances, and our moſt Dutifull Addreſſes repreſented and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to <hi>Their Majeſties:</hi> From whoſe great Wiſdom, Juſtice, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecial Care of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> We may Reaſonably and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably hope to be Delivered from our preſent Calamities, and for the Future be ſecured under a Juſt and Legal Adminiſtration, from being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore ſubjected to the Yoke of Arbitrary Government, Tyrany and Popery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:35018:8"/>In the Conduct of this, We will take Care, and do Promiſe, That no Perſon now in Arms with us, or that ſhall come to Aſſiſt us, ſhall commit any Outrage, or do any Violence to any Perſon whatſoever, that ſhall be found Peaceable and Quiet, and not oppoſe us in our ſaid Juſt and neceſſary Deſigns: And that there ſhall be Juſt and due Satisfaction made for Proviſion, and other Neceſſaries had and Received from the <hi>Inhabitants:</hi> And the Soldiers, punctually and duely Paid; in ſuch Ways and Methods as have been formerly accuſtomed, or by Law ought to be.</p>
